# End to End Machine Learning Project


This project focuses on predicting students' marks using various machine learning techniques. The primary goal of this project was to learn how to properly structure and implement a machine learning project from start to finish.


## Project Overview


This project includes:


Project Structure


Data preprocessing


Exploratory data analysis (EDA)


Feature selection and engineering


Model training and evaluation?


Flask Implementation



## Machine Learning Techniques


In this project, I experimented with different machine learning algorithms, such as:


Linear Regression 


XGBoost


Logistic Regression


Decision Tree


Random Forest


AdaBoost


Gradient Boosting

I compared the performance of these models to find the best approach for predicting student marks.


## Key Learnings

Understanding how to structure a machine learning project


Working with data preprocessing and feature engineering


Implementing multiple machine learning models and evaluating their performance
